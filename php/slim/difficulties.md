### Container with slim 4:
#### Report 1 & 2
**Problem:** there's no DI-Bridge in my case. Do you know if that's going to be supported for v4 anytime soon?  
**Answer:** you donâ€™t need DI bridge. You can use any PSR-11 container implementation you want with Slim 4.  
Go look at https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Skeleton it uses PHP-DI with Slim   
**[Source](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues/2770#issuecomment-517960368)** 
**Question:** Support missing?:   
**Answer:** Bridge not yet supported, see PHP-DI/Slim-Bridge#47  
However you can put PHP-DI in Slim manually thanks to PSR-11 (you won't get any feature of the bridge though). But maybe the PR I linked to can help you."

**Solution**  
Bridge not needed anymore.    
**Require  `"php-di/php-di": "^6.0" `**
