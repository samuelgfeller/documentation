## Update PHP or MySql

1. Download latest xampp installer https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
2. Install xampp to a new path e.g. "c:\xampp8.3"
3. Rename the `php` folder in the `xampp` folder
4. Copy the `php` folder from the new xampp folder and add it to the `c:\xampp\php` folder
5. Copy the `php.ini` file from the old php folder
6. Download the thread safe (TS) xdebug for the new php version https://xdebug.org/download
7. Put it into `php\ext` and adapt the name in `php.ini`

**Fix** *Hmmmâ€¦ can't reach this page. The connection was reset.* error `child process 12712 exited with status 3221225477` 
For the php 8.1 to 8.2 upgrade, the `apache` folder of the new xampp had to be copied as well. 
1. Rename old `apache` folder
2. Copy `apache` folder from freshly installed xampp folder and put it in `c:\xampp`
3. Replace the files from the new `apache` folder with those from the old one that had a special configuration (`httpd.conf` and `extra\httpd-vhosts.conf`)
4. Open the `C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-xampp.conf` file and replace the xampp path of the installed directory (e.g. `xampp8.3`) with `xampp` with search and replace

For MySql its pretty similar except I would do a database dump
